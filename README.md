# NeetCode-150-solutions :rocket:

Welcome to my collection of solutions to the DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) problems from the NeetCode150 list! :notebook:
## :warning: Note

The following list contains problems starting from **Linked-list** and onwards. I will continue to update this list as I solve new problems.

However, I won't include problems that I've already solved before creating this repository, including the topics: **arrays & hashing, two pointers, stack, binary search, and sliding window.**

## Index :bookmark_tabs:

- [Linked-list](#linked-list)
- [Trees](#trees)

## <a name="linked-list"></a>Linked-list Problems :link:

### EASY :baby_chick:

- [reverse linked list](linked-list/206.reverse-linked-list)
- [merge two sorted lists](linked-list/21.merge-two-sorted-lists)
- [linked list cycle](linked-list/141.linked-list-cycle)

### MEDIUM :turtle:

- [reorder list](linked-list/143.reorder-list)
- [remove nth node from end of list](linked-list/19.remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list)
- [copy list with random pointer](linked-list/138.copy-list-with-random-pointer)
- [add two numbers](linked-list/2.add-two-numbers)
- [find the duplicate number](linked-list/287.find-the-duplicate-number)
- [LRU cache](linked-list/146.LRU-cache)

### HARD :fire:

- [merge k sorted lists](linked-list/23.merge-k-sorted-lists)
- [reverse nodes in k-group](linked-list/25.reverse-nodes-in-k-group)

## <a name="trees"></a>Tree Problems :link:

### EASY :baby_chick:
- [invert binary tree](trees/226.invert-binary-tree)
- [maximum depth of binary tree](trees/104.maximum-depth-of-binary-tree)
- [diameter of binary tree](trees/543.diameter-of-binary-tree)
- [balanced binary tree](trees/110.balanced-binary-tree)
- [same tree](trees/100.same-tree)
- [subtree of another tree](trees/572.subtree-of-another-tree)

Feel free to explore the solutions and learn from them. Happy coding! :smiley:
